**TRELLIS.2** is a state-of-the-art large 3D generative model (4B parameters) designed for high-fidelity **image-to-3D** generation. It leverages a novel "field-free" sparse voxel structure termed **O-Voxel** to reconstruct and generate arbitrary 3D assets with complex topologies, sharp features, and full PBR materials.


## ✨ Features

### 1. High Quality, Resolution & Efficiency
Our 4B-parameter model generates high-resolution fully textured assets with exceptional fidelity and efficiency using vanilla DiTs. It utilizes a Sparse 3D VAE with 16× spatial downsampling to encode assets into a compact latent space.

| Resolution | Total Time* | Breakdown (Shape + Mat) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **512³** | **~3s** | 2s + 1s |
| **1024³** | **~17s** | 10s + 7s |
| **1536³** | **~60s** | 35s + 25s |

<small>*Tested on NVIDIA H100 GPU.</small>

### 2. Arbitrary Topology Handling
The **O-Voxel** representation breaks the limits of iso-surface fields. It robustly handles complex structures without lossy conversion:
*   ✅ **Open Surfaces** (e.g., clothing, leaves)
*   ✅ **Non-manifold Geometry**
*   ✅ **Internal Enclosed Structures**

### 3. Rich Texture Modeling
Beyond basic colors, TRELLIS.2 models arbitrary surface attributes including **Base Color, Roughness, Metallic, and Opacity**, enabling photorealistic rendering and transparency support.

### 4. Minimalist Processing
Data processing is streamlined for instant conversions that are fully **rendering-free** and **optimization-free**.
*   **< 10s** (Single CPU): Textured Mesh → O-Voxel
*   **< 100ms** (CUDA): O-Voxel → Textured Mesh

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **System**: The code is currently tested only on **Linux**.
- **Hardware**: An NVIDIA GPU with at least 24GB of memory is necessary. The code has been verified on NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs.  
- **Software**:   
  - The [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) is needed to compile certain packages. Recommended version is 12.4.  
  - [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) is recommended for managing dependencies.  
  - Python version 3.8 or higher is required. 

### Installation Steps

#### Windows (Python 3.13 + RTX 50-series / Blackwell)
This fork includes a pip-first Windows path for Python 3.13, CUDA Toolkit 13.0, PyTorch `2.13.0+cu130`, and NVIDIA RTX 50-series / Blackwell GPUs (`sm_120`). Conda is not required.

1. Clone the repo and initialize submodules:
    ```powershell
    git clone -b windows-blackwell https://github.com/rwfsmith/TRELLIS.2.git --recursive
    cd TRELLIS.2
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. Create and activate a Python 3.13 virtual environment:
    ```powershell
    py -3.13 -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    ```

3. Install Visual Studio 2022 C++ build tools and CUDA Toolkit 13.0. Then install dependencies:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_windows.ps1 -Python .\venv\Scripts\python.exe
    ```
    The setup script wraps:
    ```powershell
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-build-isolation
    ```
    and sets the native build environment variables needed by PyTorch CUDA extensions:
    `CUDA_HOME`, `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.0`, `DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1`, and `MSSdk=1`.

    If CUDA is installed somewhere other than `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v13.0`, pass it explicitly:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_windows.ps1 -Python .\venv\Scripts\python.exe -CudaHome "D:\CUDA\v13.0"
    ```

    If you are running from `cmd.exe` instead of PowerShell, use the bundled batch wrapper instead (it forwards all arguments to `setup_windows.ps1`):
    ```bat
    setup_windows.bat -Python .\venv\Scripts\python.exe
    ```

    Alternatively, a pure Python setup script is provided for those who prefer not to invoke PowerShell or a `.bat` file at all:
    ```
    python setup_windows.py --python .\venv\Scripts\python.exe
    ```
    It performs the same steps as `setup_windows.ps1` (locate VS2022 build tools, set `CUDA_HOME`/`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`, then `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-build-isolation`). Use `--cuda-home` and `--torch-cuda-arch-list` to override the CUDA path or target GPU architecture.

    On Windows, TRELLIS.2 does not require `flash-attn`: at startup it probes whether `flash_attn` is installed and actually runs on your GPU, and automatically falls back to PyTorch SDPA if it's missing or fails. If you install a working `flash-attn` build, it will be used automatically; you can still force a specific backend with `ATTN_BACKEND` or `SPARSE_ATTN_BACKEND` (`xformers`, `flash_attn`, `flash_attn_3`, `sdpa`, `naive`).

    This fork's `requirements.txt` pins `cumesh` and `flex_gemm` to exact commits of [rwfsmith/CuMesh](https://github.com/rwfsmith/CuMesh) and [rwfsmith/FlexGEMM](https://github.com/rwfsmith/FlexGEMM). Besides the Windows/CUDA-13 build fixes, those commits carry two **cross-platform correctness fixes** to CuMesh that are not specific to this fork's platform support:

    - **Out-of-bounds UDF read in the narrow-band dual contouring remesh kernel.** Caused `o_voxel.postprocess.to_glb(..., remesh=True)` (used by `extract_glb()` in `app.py`) to non-deterministically produce shredded/spiky meshes — identical code and latents could yield a clean or corrupted mesh from run to run. Upstreamed as [CuMesh#39](https://github.com/JeffreyXiang/CuMesh/pull/39).
    - **Uninitialized CUB reduction identity in `fill_holes`.** `fill_holes` averages hole-cap vertices with `cub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::Sum` over `Vec3f`. CUB builds the reduction identity on the *host* as `InitT{}`, but `Vec3f` has a user-provided default constructor (so `Vec3f{}` calls it instead of zero-filling) that is marked `__device__`-only (so it isn't callable from host code). The identity was therefore raw host stack memory, folded into every segment sum. Because it depends on stack residue, the first generation in a process was usually clean and **every generation after it was corrupt**, smearing the model into a cylindrical column of sliver triangles — so it only showed up from the second image onward in the long-lived Gradio app. Upstreamed as [CuMesh#41](https://github.com/JeffreyXiang/CuMesh/pull/41).

    If you see corrupted meshes, verify you are building against these pinned commits rather than upstream `main`.

    This fork also fixes the DINOv3 image conditioning for Transformers 5.x. Recent releases moved the DINOv3 transformer blocks from `DINOv3ViTModel.layer` to `DINOv3ViTModel.model.layer`, so the original lookup missed them. Falling back to `last_hidden_state` is *not* equivalent: `DINOv3ViTModel.forward` applies the backbone's trained final `LayerNorm`, whose learned affine shifts the feature distribution TRELLIS.2 was conditioned on. The resulting out-of-distribution conditioning made the sparse-structure flow sampler collapse to an all-empty voxel grid on roughly 1 seed in 6, surfacing 300 lines downstream as a cryptic `RuntimeError: max(): Expected reduction dim to be specified for input.numel() == 0`. `DinoV3FeatureExtractor.extract_features` now locates the block list across Transformers versions, runs the blocks directly, and applies a parameter-free `F.layer_norm`. On a fixed 40-seed sweep this took empty-grid failures from 7/40 to 0/40 and tightened the generated voxel count from 139–2169 to 3299–4338, so it improves output fidelity on every seed, not just the ones that crashed.

4. Log in to Hugging Face before running the pretrained model. TRELLIS.2 loads gated dependencies, including `facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m`, so your account must have access:
    ```powershell
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

5. Run the full image-to-3D example:
    ```powershell
    python example.py
    ```
    A successful run writes `sample.mp4` and `sample.glb`.

#### Linux
1. Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone -b main https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS.2.git --recursive
    cd TRELLIS.2
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    
    **Before running the following command there are somethings to note:**
    - By adding `--new-env`, a new conda environment named `trellis2` will be created. If you want to use an existing conda environment, please remove this flag.
    - By default the `trellis2` environment will use pytorch 2.6.0 with CUDA 12.4. If you want to use a different version of CUDA, you can remove the `--new-env` flag and manually install the required dependencies. Refer to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for the installation command.
    - If you have multiple CUDA Toolkit versions installed, `CUDA_HOME` should be set to the correct version before running the command. For example, if you have CUDA Toolkit 12.4 and 13.0 installed, you can run `export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.4` before running the command.
    - By default, the code uses the `flash-attn` backend for attention. For GPUs do not support `flash-attn` (e.g., NVIDIA V100), you can install `xformers` manually and set the `ATTN_BACKEND` environment variable to `xformers` before running the code. See the [Minimal Example](#minimal-example) for more details.
    - The installation may take a while due to the large number of dependencies. Please be patient. If you encounter any issues, you can try to install the dependencies one by one, specifying one flag at a time.
    - If you encounter any issues during the installation, feel free to open an issue or contact us.
    
    Create a new conda environment named `trellis2` and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    . ./setup.sh --new-env --basic --flash-attn --nvdiffrast --nvdiffrec --cumesh --o-voxel --flexgemm
    ```
    The detailed usage of `setup.sh` can be found by running `. ./setup.sh --help`.
    ```sh
    Usage: setup.sh [OPTIONS]
    Options:
        -h, --help              Display this help message
        --new-env               Create a new conda environment
        --basic                 Install basic dependencies
        --flash-attn            Install flash-attention
        --cumesh                Install cumesh
        --o-voxel               Install o-voxel
        --flexgemm              Install flexgemm
        --nvdiffrast            Install nvdiffrast
        --nvdiffrec             Install nvdiffrec
    ```

## 🔁 CI/CD (Fork)

This fork includes a GitHub Actions workflow at [.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml):

- **CI / PR build**: runs on every PR targeting `main` (opened/synchronize/reopened/ready_for_review), plus direct pushes to `main`.
- **Checks performed**: validates dependency spec syntax in `requirements.txt` and `o-voxel/pyproject.toml`, then compiles Python sources (`compileall`) for a fast build smoke test.
- **CD snapshot on `main`**: after a successful `main` push build, uploads a `build-manifest.json` artifact with commit/run metadata.

## 📦 Pretrained Weights

The pretrained model **TRELLIS.2-4B** is available on Hugging Face. Please refer to the model card there for more details.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Image to 3D Generation

#### Minimal Example

Here is an [example](example.py) of how to use the pretrained models for 3D asset generation.

```python
import os
os.environ['OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR'] = '1'
os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "expandable_segments:True"  # Can save GPU memory
import cv2
import imageio
from PIL import Image
import torch
from trellis2.pipelines import Trellis2ImageTo3DPipeline
from trellis2.utils import render_utils
from trellis2.renderers import EnvMap
import o_voxel

# 1. Setup Environment Map
envmap = EnvMap(torch.tensor(
    cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread('assets/hdri/forest.exr', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB),
    dtype=torch.float32, device='cuda'
))

# 2. Load Pipeline
pipeline = Trellis2ImageTo3DPipeline.from_pretrained("microsoft/TRELLIS.2-4B")
pipeline.cuda()

# 3. Load Image & Run
image = Image.open("assets/example_image/T.png")
mesh = pipeline.run(image)[0]
mesh.simplify(16777216) # nvdiffrast limit

# 4. Render Video
video = render_utils.make_pbr_vis_frames(render_utils.render_video(mesh, envmap=envmap))
imageio.mimsave("sample.mp4", video, fps=15)

# 5. Export to GLB
glb = o_voxel.postprocess.to_glb(
    vertices            =   mesh.vertices,
    faces               =   mesh.faces,
    attr_volume         =   mesh.attrs,
    coords              =   mesh.coords,
    attr_layout         =   mesh.layout,
    voxel_size          =   mesh.voxel_size,
    aabb                =   [[-0.5, -0.5, -0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]],
    decimation_target   =   1000000,
    texture_size        =   4096,
    remesh              =   True,
    remesh_band         =   1,
    remesh_project      =   0,
    verbose             =   True
)
glb.export("sample.glb", extension_webp=True)
```

Upon execution, the script generates the following files:
 - `sample.mp4`: A video visualizing the generated 3D asset with PBR materials and environmental lighting.
 - `sample.glb`: The extracted PBR-ready 3D asset in GLB format.

**Note:** The `.glb` file is exported in `OPAQUE` mode by default. Although the alpha channel is preserved within the texture map, it is not active initially. To enable transparency, import the asset into your 3D software and manually connect the texture's alpha channel to the material's opacity or alpha input.

#### Web Demo

[app.py](app.py) provides a simple web demo for image to 3D asset generation. you can run the demo with the following command:
```sh
python app.py
```

Then, you can access the demo at the address shown in the terminal.

### 2. PBR Texture Generation

Please refer to the [example_texturing.py](example_texturing.py) for an example of how to generate PBR textures for a given 3D shape. Also, you can use the [app_texturing.py](app_texturing.py) to run a web demo for PBR texture generation.


## 🏋️ Training

We provide the full training codebase, enabling users to train **TRELLIS.2** from scratch or fine-tune it on custom datasets.

### 1. Data Preparation

Before training, raw 3D assets must be converted into the **O-Voxel** representation. This process includes mesh conversion, compact structured latent generation, and metadata preparation.

> 📂 **Please refer to [data_toolkit/README.md](data_toolkit/README.md) for detailed instructions on data preprocessing and dataset organization.**

### 2. Running Training

Training is managed through the `train.py` script, which accepts multiple command-line arguments to configure experiments:

* `--config`: Path to the experiment configuration file.
* `--output_dir`: Directory for training outputs.
* `--load_dir`: Directory to load checkpoints from (defaults to `output_dir`).
* `--ckpt`: Checkpoint step to resume from (defaults to the latest).
* `--data_dir`: Dataset path or a JSON string specifying dataset locations.
* `--auto_retry`: Number of automatic retries upon failure.
* `--tryrun`: Perform a dry run without actual training.
* `--profile`: Enable training profiling.
* `--num_nodes`: Number of nodes for distributed training.
* `--node_rank`: Rank of the current node.
* `--num_gpus`: Number of GPUs per node (defaults to all available GPUs).
* `--master_addr`: Master node address for distributed training.
* `--master_port`: Port for distributed training communication.


### SC-VAE Training


To train the shape SC-VAE, run:

```sh
python train.py \
  --config configs/scvae/shape_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16.json \
  --output_dir results/shape_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16 \
  --data_dir "{\"ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\": {\"base\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\", \"mesh_dump\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/mesh_dumps\", \"dual_grid\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/dual_grid_256\", \"asset_stats\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/asset_stats\"}}"
```

This command trains the shape SC-VAE on the **Objaverse-XL** dataset using the `shape_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16.json` configuration. Training outputs will be saved to `results/shape_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16`.

The dataset is specified as a JSON string, where each dataset entry includes:

* `base`: Root directory of the dataset.
* `mesh_dump`: Directory containing preprocessed mesh dumps.
* `dual_grid`: Directory with precomputed dual-grid representations.
* `asset_stats`: Directory containing precomputed asset statistics.

To fine-tune the model at a higher resolution, use the `shape_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16_ft_512.json` configuration. Remember to update the `finetune_ckpt` field and adjust the dataset paths accordingly.


To train the texture SC-VAE, run:

```sh
python train.py \
  --config configs/scvae/tex_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16.json \
  --output_dir results/tex_vae_next_dc_f16c32_fp16 \
  --data_dir "{\"ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\": {\"base\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\", \"pbr_dump\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/pbr_dumps\", \"pbr_voxel\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/pbr_voxels_256\", \"asset_stats\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/asset_stats\"}}"
```


### Flow Model Training

python train.py \
  --config configs/gen/ss_flow_img_dit_1_3B_64_bf16.json \
  --output_dir results/ss_flow_img_dit_1_3B_64_bf16 \
  --data_dir "{\"ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\": {\"base\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\", \"ss_latent\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/ss_latents/ss_enc_conv3d_16l8_fp16_64\", \"render_cond\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/renders_cond\"}}"
```

This command trains the sparse-structure flow model on the **Objaverse-XL** dataset using the specified configuration file. Outputs are saved to `results/ss_flow_img_dit_1_3B_64_bf16`.

The dataset configuration includes:

* `base`: Root dataset directory.
* `ss_latent`: Directory containing precomputed sparse-structure latents.
* `render_cond`: Directory containing conditional rendering images.


The second- and third-stage flow models for shape and texture generation can be trained using the following configurations:

* Texture flow: `slat_flow_imgshape2tex_dit_1_3B_512_bf16.json`

Example commands:

```sh
# Shape flow model
python train.py \
  --config configs/gen/slat_flow_img2shape_dit_1_3B_512_bf16.json \
  --output_dir results/slat_flow_img2shape_dit_1_3B_512_bf16 \
  --data_dir "{\"ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\": {\"base\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab\", \"shape_latent\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/shape_latents/shape_enc_next_dc_f16c32_fp16_512\", \"render_cond\": \"datasets/ObjaverseXL_sketchfab/renders_cond\"}}"

# Texture flow model
python train.py \
  --config configs/gen/slat_flow_imgshape2tex_dit_1_3B_512_bf16.json \

```

Higher-resolution fine-tuning can be performed by updating the `finetune_ckpt` field in the following configuration files and adjusting the dataset paths accordingly:

* `slat_flow_img2shape_dit_1_3B_512_bf16_ft1024.json`
* `slat_flow_imgshape2tex_dit_1_3B_512_bf16_ft1024.json`
